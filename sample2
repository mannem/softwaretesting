About Project Gutenberg-TM Etexts

This PROJECT GUTENBERG-TM etext, like most PROJECT GUTENBERG-TM
etexts, is a “public domain” work distributed by Professor Michael
S. Hart through the Project Gutenberg Association (the “Project”).

Among other things, this means that no one owns a United States
copyright on or for this work, so the Project (and you!) can copy
and distribute it in the United States without permission and
without paying copyright royalties. Special rules, set forth below,
apply if you wish to copy and distribute this etext under the
Project’s “PROJECT GUTENBERG” trademark.

To create these etexts, the Project expends considerable
efforts to identify, transcribe and proofread public domain
works. Despite these efforts, the Project’s etexts and any
medium they may be on may contain “Defects”. Among other
things, Defects may take the form of incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged
disk or other etext medium, a computer virus, or computer
codes that damage or cannot be read by your equipment.
